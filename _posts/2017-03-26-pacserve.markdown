If you have multiple Arch Linux machine (and slow internet like me :p) you could update Arch on one machine ane make that server for your other Arch machine to update. Xyne make apps to do that magic called ``pacserve``

To install ``pacserve`` you can add xyne repo or with aur, either way, it's same.

### repo
add xyne repo to ``/etc/pacman.conf``
```conf
[xyne-any]
# A repo for Xyne's own projects: http://xyne.archlinux.ca/projects/
# Packages for "any" architecture.
# Use this repo only if there is no matching [xyne-*] repo for your architecture.
SigLevel = Required
Server = http://xyne.archlinux.ca/repos/xyne

[xyne-i686]
# A repo for Xyne's own projects: http://xyne.archlinux.ca/projects/
# Packages for the "i686" architecture.
# Note that this includes all packages in [xyne-any].
SigLevel = Required
Server = http://xyne.archlinux.ca/repos/xyne

[xyne-x86_64]
# A repo for Xyne's own projects: http://xyne.archlinux.ca/projects/
# Packages for the "x86_64" architecture.
# Note that this includes all packages in [xyne-any].
SigLevel = Required
Server = http://xyne.archlinux.ca/repos/xyne
``` 
and then
```shell_session
users $ sudo pacman -Sy
users $ sudo pacman -S pacserve
```

### aur

```shell_session
users $ gpg --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu C2E5C0D2
users $ pacaur -y pacserve
```

And then enable and start pacserve service on your server and other Arch machine
```shell_session
users $ sudo systemctl enable pacserve
users $ sudo systemctl start pacserve
```

if you wanna update from your server use command :
```shell_session
users $ sudo pacsrv -Syu
```

If you do not want to use the pacsrv wrapper script then add ``Include = /etc/pacman.d/pacserve`` (above official repo) to your pacman.conf
```conf
[core]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/pacserve
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```
