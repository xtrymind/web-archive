For xiaomi devices with unofficial support of treble, it use unused `cust` partition as `vendor` partititon. In Magisk to mount `/vendor` partition, it search partition with name vendor then mount it, it's problem with xiaomi device that uses `/cust` as `vendor` because it name still `cust`. As of now, since topjohnwu on military duty, there isn't official way to handle this issue, as unofficial way, we change mount `vendor` to mount `cust`.

This is just self compiled Magisk with change on mount `vendor` to `cust` partition
