There's lot of cli based system information on linux, like neofetch, screenfetch, etc.
inxi is one of those cli based system information, with a lot of options to get all system informations you need
like cpu, machine, bios graphic, network, audio, drives and more.

install with command
{% highlight bash %}
 $ sudo pacman -S inxi
{% endhighlight %}

first, run this command
{% highlight bash %}
 $ inxi --recommend
{% endhighlight %}
that command will check application dependencies + recommends, and directories, then shows what package(s) you need to install to add support for that feature

{% highlight bash %}
 # this command will give you basic output of system informations
 $ inxi -b
 
 # or with inxi -F
 $ inxi -F
 
 # run man inxi for detailed informations to get system information you need
 $ man inxi
{% endhighlight %}

or check [inxi-man](http://smxi.org/docs/inxi-man.htm)
