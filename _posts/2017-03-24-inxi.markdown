There's lot of cli based system information on linux, like neofetch, screenfetch, etc.
inxi is one of those cli based system information, with a lot of options to get all system informations you need
like cpu, machine, bios graphic, network, audio, drives and more.

install with command
```shell_session
users $ sudo pacman -S inxi
```

first, run this command
```shell_session
users $ inxi --recommend
```
that command will check application dependencies + recommends, and directories, then shows what package(s) you need to install to add support for that feature

```shell_session
this command will give you basic output of system informations
users $ inxi -b
 
or with inxi -F
users $ inxi -F
 
run man inxi for detailed informations to get system information you need
users $ man inxi
```

or check [inxi-man](http://smxi.org/docs/inxi-man.htm)
