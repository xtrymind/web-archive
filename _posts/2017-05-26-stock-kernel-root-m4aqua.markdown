well, SuperSu ship it twrp installer with script to modify ramdisk and adding it to ramdisk make it seamless root, but for some reason, it doesn't work with Sony kernel.

some say, while sony ship it kernel with gzip format, it has modified by sony so SuperSu can't do it automatically. So we must use manual mode. this post will update when a new SuperSu version come out.
