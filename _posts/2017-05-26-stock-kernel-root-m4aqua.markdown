SuperSu offer zip file (to flash with twrp or other recovery) with a script to modify ramdisk and adding supersu to ramdisk to make it seamless root, but for some reason, it doesn't work with Sony kernel (M4Aqua to be exact, i don't know other device) .

Some say, while sony ship it kernel with gzip format, it was modified so SuperSu can't do it automatically. So we must use manual mode. this post will update when a new SuperSu version come out.
